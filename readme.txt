The game we have chosen is Tetris. The aim of the game is to make the best score. The game starts when you are asked to choose the height and width of the grid.

The score increases by completing rows, not columns. In order to complete these rows, you will have to place the pieces strategically. The pieces will be defined randomly. The game will then ask you to choose an orientation of the piece, as well as its column. Each piece consists of four squares. So to choose the right column of the piece, you will have to indicate the column of the bottom leftmost square.

If you take more than 15 seconds to place the coin, then the coin will be placed in a randomly chosen column.

The more rows you complete with a coin, the more points you get:

for one line cleared, you gain 10 points
for two lines, you gain 40 points
for three lines, 
for four lines, you get 1200 points
The game ends when one of the pieces reaches the top of the grid, you will be warned when the outgoing pieces are displayed with #'s instead of O's. It can also end after a certain time determined by the width you have chosen at the beginning. At the end of the game, the game will ask you for your nickname to see if you have beaten the game's record. If you did, your name and score will be entered into a file, and other users will try to beat your record.


To compile the program and run it, simply enter the command "make" on your terminal. To delete the executable file and the object files, you will have to enter "make clean".
